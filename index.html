<div id="scrollContent"><p>A Yonder relies on superior technical skills and in-depth understanding of business principles to help you realize your ambitions. We begin by helping you define your product’s business goals. Throughout the development and deployment phases, we ensure your project remains on target to meet those goals. You can focus on your domain of expertise and on your customers’ needs, safe in the knowledge that the technical aspects of your project are in good hands.
Yonder’s European and U.S. clients operate in many different verticals in the public and private sectors (healthcare, local government, finance and insurance, waste management, legal, security and surveillance, lease management, food service and education.) They also include horizontal software companies. We are organized in four nimble units that each has a director who leads the teams in the unit. And Yonder has two CTO’s. This enables us to be close to our clients and increases our efficiency and effectiveness. Our Managing Director oversees all four units.
